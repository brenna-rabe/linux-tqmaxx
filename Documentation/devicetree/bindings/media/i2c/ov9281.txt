* Omnivision OV9281 CMOS sensor

Required Properties:
- compatible: shall be one of
	"ovti,ov9281"
- clocks: reference to the xvclk input clock.
- clock-names: Must include the following entry: "xvclk"
- avdd-supply: Analog voltage supply
- dovdd-supply: Digital I/O voltage supply
- dvdd-supply: Digital core voltage supply

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the resetb pin, if any.
  Active is high.
- pwdn-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the pwdn pin, if any.
  Active is high.

The device node shall contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
subnode for its digital output video port, in accordance with the video
interface bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/
video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c0 {
	ov9281: camera@30 {
		compatible = "ovti,ov9281";
		reg = <0x30>;
		reset-gpios = <&axi_gpio_0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		pwdn-gpios = <&axi_gpio_0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		avdd-supply = <&pp2800_cam>;
		dovdd-supply = <&pp1800>;
		dvdd-supply = <&pp1800>;

		clocks = <&cru SCLK_TESTCLKOUT1>;
		clock-names = "xvclk";

		port {
			ov9281: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&vcap1_in0>;
			};
		};
	};
};
