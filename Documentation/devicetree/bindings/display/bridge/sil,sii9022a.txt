Device-Tree bindings for the SiI902x hdmi transmitter.
-----------------------------------------

The SiI9022A is an ultra low-power HDMI transmitter. It supports resolutions from
standard definition 480i/p and 576i/p all the way to high-definition 720p, 1080i,
and 1080p, the highest resolution supported by HDTVs today. It also supports all
PC resolutions up to UXGA for netbooks

Required properties:
- compatible: 	Should be "sil,sii9022a".
- reg: 		The I2C address of the device.
- interrupts:	Interrupt number to the cpu.

Required nodes:

The sii9022 has one video ports. Its connection is modelled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for the HDMI output

Example:
-------

/ {
	hdmi-out {
		compatible = "hdmi-connector";
		type = "a";

		port {
			hdmi_con: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&sii9022a_out>;
			};
		};
	};
};

&i2c1 {
    sii9022: hdmi@39 {
            compatible = "sil,sii9022a";
            reg = <0x39>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 167 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

            ports {
                    #address-cells = <1>;
                    #size-cells = <0>;

                    port@0 {
                            reg = <0>;
                            sii9022_out: endpoint {
                                    remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_con>;
                            };
                    };
            };
    };
};
