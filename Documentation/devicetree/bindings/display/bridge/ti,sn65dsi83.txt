SN65DSI83 DSI to LVDS bridge chip
---------------------------------

This is the binding for Texas Instruments SN65DSI83 bridge.
http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn65dsi83&fileType=pdf

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ti,sn65dsi83"
- reg: i2c address of the chip, 0x2d as per datasheet

Optional properties:
- vcc1v8-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the chip.
- enable-gpios: gpio specification for bridge_en pin (active high)

Required nodes:
This device has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the
OF graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for DSI input
- Video port 1 for LVDS output

Example
-------

lvds-bridge@2d {
	compatible = "ti,sn65dsi83";
	reg = <0x2d>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio3 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

	vcc1v8-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;

	clock-names = "refclk";
	clocks = <&input_refclk>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			edp_bridge_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			edp_bridge_out: endpoint {
				data-lanes = <2 1 3 0>;
				lane-polarities = <0 1 0 1>;
				remote-endpoint = <&edp_panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};
}
